# ETH+AVAX Intermediate Module 1

This Solidity program is a simple program that demonstrates the usage of `assert`, `revert`, `require`. The purpose of this program is to apply the usage in this project.

## Description

This program is a simple contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract has a three functions which are used to manage the state i.e `totalSUpply`. `burnSupply` function is used to decrease `totalSupply`. `setSupply` function is used to set the `totalSupply` value. `addSupply` function is used to increase the `totalSupply`.

## Getting Started

### Executing program

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with error_handling.sol extension (e.g., HelloWorld.sol). Copy and paste the `error_handling.sol` file into the file:


To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.4" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile error_handling.sol" button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "Module1" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.

Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it by calling the `addSupply`, `setSupply`, `burnSupply` function. Click on the "Module1" contract in the left-hand sidebar. You can also check `totalSupply` by clicking on it.
